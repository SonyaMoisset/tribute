Starting with a document written in French by Luigi Menabrea, an Italian mathematician, Lovelace added extensive notes to the English translation, including the world’s first computer algorithm.</p><p>The Analytical Engine was intended to count Bernoulli numbers, but Babbage was unsuccessful in getting the funding to build his machine.

She is most famously associated with the Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL), which was based on the FLOW-MATIC language that she designed back in 1958.</p><p>Before the invention of such language-based programming, computers spoke exclusively in binary code, which was illegible to human beings. Hopper was convinced that if programming were produced in a form that anyone could read, then there would be more programmers. It turns out that she was right.</p><p>While COBOL isn’t exactly the cutting edge of programming technology today, it still has a faithful following. In fact, in a recent Computerworld survey, 53 percent of the organizations that responded said that they were using COBOL to build new business applications.</p><h3 class="mother-subtitle">Where is she now?</h3><p>For years, Grace Hopper toured the country, visiting schools and military bases to give lectures on computers and the history of programming languages. She memorably sat down with David Letterman in 1986 and discussed her time spent with the first computer, the Mark I.</p><p>Hopper died in 1992 at the age of 85.</p><h3 class="mother-subtitle">Words of Wisdom</h3><blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"> <p>“We're only at the beginning.

She played a key role in the invention of spread-spectrum technology; specifically, by conceptualizing the idea of frequency hopping, which is a method of sending radio signals from different frequency channels.</p><p>Lamarr and her co-inventor, George Antheil, developed the technology originally to help the Navy remotely control torpedoes. The key value of frequency hopping was that the randomized channel switching made it difficult for outside agents to understand what was being communicated. It was, in essence, an early form of encryption technology.</p><p>The two received a patent on their idea on August 11, 1942, according to the American Heritage of Invention & Technology. But despite lobbying and fundraising efforts on their part, the Navy ultimately passed on the technology.</p><p>It was reborn, however, in the late 1950s when engineers at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division revived it, which led to the use of Lamarr’s frequency hopping concept in secure military communications. Her work on spread-spectrum has played a part in many modern wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).</p><h3 class="mother-subtitle">Where is she now?</h3><p>After initially receiving very little recognition for her work on spread-spectrum technology, Lamarr was honored with a special award: the Pioneer Award by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 1997. This long overdue recognition for her scientific endeavors came just three years before her death, in 2000.</p><p>Her legacy lives on in the world of wireless technologies, and through the continued efforts of her son Anthony Loder. He recently spoke with CBS News about his mother’s gift for invention, which is the subject of Hedy’s Folly, a new book by Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Richard Rhodes.</p><h3 class="mother-subtitle">Words of Wisdom</h3><blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"> <p>“When they called her up to tell her she would get the award, her first words were, Hedy Lamarr being Hedy Lamarr, ‘Well, it's about time.’”</p><footer><cite>Writer Richard Rhodes recalls Lamarr's response to her award in an NPR story</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="col-xs-12"><img src="images/hedy-lamarr-thumbnail.jpeg" class="img-responsive"></div><div class="col-xs-12"><p class="text-center">Learn more about Hedy Lamarr on:</p><div class="center-icon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr" alt="Hedy Lamarr" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-wikipedia-w fa-2x"></i></a><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001443/" alt="Hedy Lamarr" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-film fa-2x"></i></a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr" alt="Hedy Lamarr" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i></a></div></div></div></div><div id="erna-hoover" class="section-container container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 text-center"> <h1 class="mother-main-title">Dr. Erna Hoover</h1><h5 class="text-muted">Telephony Hero</h5></div><div class="col-xs-6"><h3 class="mother-subtitle">Her impact on technology</h3><p>Dropped calls and busy signals are an annoyance that most could do without.

Basically it was designed to keep the machine from throwing up its hands and going berserk,” Hoover told the New Jersey Star-Ledger.</p><p>Her 1971 patent for this technology was among one of the first software patents ever issued. Even more impressive: She worked on her idea while still in the hospital following the birth of her second daughter.</p><h3 class="mother-subtitle">Where is she now?</h3><p>In 2008, Hoover was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, for her work on telephony.

If Jobs is credited with making technology more personable through Apple’s devices, it’s in part because of Kare’s efforts to make the computer feel more like a friend — and less like a machine.</p><p>But she didn’t work exclusively on Apple products. In the mid-1980s, after Jobs was forced out, Kare left Apple and worked with Microsoft, where she applied her design skills to humanizing the Windows 3.0 operating system.</p><p>Kare’s design work didn’t stop with Apple and Microsoft.
